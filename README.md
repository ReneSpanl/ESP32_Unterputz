# ESP32_Unterputz
A PCB to allow an ESP32 in an Underputz spacing, using this small spacing underneath a wall mount means that the tolerances are extraordinarily small. Therefor use your own brain to make it work, Modules other than the ESP32-WROOM-U do not specifically work, because the pre-mounted antenna is using too much space.
